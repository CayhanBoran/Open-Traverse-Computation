# Open-Traverse-Computation
  Open Traverse does not create a closed shape and begin at a point of known position and ends at a point of unknown position. In computational check, it is not possible to detect error or blunder in distance and directions. To calculate the coordinates for each point on a traverse, the direction and distance from a known point must also be known. Once the distance and direction values are known, the latitude (DX) and departure (DY) can be calculated. These values will indicate the distances north or south and east or west between the two points. The coordinates of the unknown point can then be determined by algebraically adding the latitude to the northing of the known point and the departure to the easting of the known point

  A program to calculate an open traverse serie. The input values (known coordinates,traverse angles, traverse leg distances, traverse point IDs) for the program should be entered by the user manually.The results of the calculations should be printed to the screen using proper notation as given in examples. Every component of the calculation should be clearly explained to the user before and after the calculation. Please take into account that the x axis shows the north direction
